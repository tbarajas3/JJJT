# JJJT

App Description: 
The app will be a food guide for people indecisive about what to eat. There will be prompts asking questions, narrowing down the options to one specific type of food. There will also be features to randomly pick a restaurant if many people are wanting to go to different locations. More features to be added soon as well.

App Design:
We will be using python, Javascript to create a web app. It will have functionality such as comments, to allow users to leave reccomendations on specific restaurants or food.

Audience Intended for:
This is designed for people who have no clue what to eat for the day. They might be tired of the same meal, and want something new but cannot put the effort into thinking of what to eat.

Social Impact:
This could help society by encouraging people to try new food, support local businesses, and encourage social interaction with friends at restaurants.
